        <h4 class=myheader>Selection tools</h4>
        <!--<p class=ptext>The viewer offers a set of tools to ease the selection of the atoms or molecules of interest.</p>-->
        
        <h5 class=subsect>Quick selection</h5>
        <p class=ptext>Quick-selection buttons allow to rapidly display the molecules present at the dynamics. Hover the buttons with your mouse to see the abbreviated name of these molecules, which can be used to create your own selections.</p>
        
        <p class=prelist>In the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Structure selections</span>, It is also possible to select the residues or molecules that are found <span class=highlight>within a certain distance of a ligand</span>. It is only necessary to:</p>
        <ol style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <li>Indicate what you want to visualize (residues or molecules found at the simulation).</li>
            <li>Input the wanted threshold distance (in angstroms).</li>
            <li>Indicate the molecule type around which the selection is made. Apart from predefined molecules, it is also possible to show the residues/molecules that are close to a personalized selection which, again, can include generic GPCR residue numbering.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class=ptext>If the selection is correct, a green checkmark (<span style="color:#7acc00;font-size:10px" class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>) will appear at the left. More than one distance selection can be displayed at the same time. Selections made with this tool will appear in coral red. The  distance selection will be updated for each trajectory frame, as the disposition of the atoms may change.</p> 
        

        <h5 class=subsect>Custom selection</h5>
        <p class=ptext>Use the text input field to specify your personalized representations. You can choose a representation type (licorice, cartoon, etc.) and a coloring scheme (color by element, by chain, etc.).</p>
        <p class=ptext>Selections must be expressed using the <a href="http://proteinformatics.charite.de/ngl/doc/index.html#User_manual/Usage/Selection_language" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">NGL selection language</a>. Moreover, to indicate protein residues it is also possible to use <span class=highlight>generic GPCR residue numbering</span>: Ballesteros-Weinstein (ex. <span style="font-style:italic">1.50</span>), GPCRdb structure-based numbering (ex. <span style="font-style:italic">1x50</span>) or a combination of both (ex. <span style="font-style:italic">1.50x50</span>).</p>
        
        <p class=ptext>For example, if you input <span class="input_ex">40-70:P or CLZ</span>, residues numbered from 40 to 70 at the PDB belonging to chain P and Clozapine will be displayed. Another example, this time using a combination of different generic GPCR numbering styles, could be <span class="input_ex">1.50 - 2x48 or 3.35x35  or SOD</span>.</p>

        <h5 class=subsect>Sequence selection</h5>
        <p class=ptext>The GPCR Workbench also provides the option to select a protein segment from its sequence. Set your selection by clicking at the desired range or ranges of residues, selected segments will appear at the sequence in green. To deselect a residue range from the sequence, just click on it. Finally, click at <span class=highlight>Confirm selection</span>: the residue range(s) will be added to a text input field, which you can modify to adjust the selection to what you want to display. If you want to add new sequence selections, click at the <span style="color: rgb(87, 200, 87)" class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus-sign"></span> button.</p>

        <h5 class=subsect>GPCR conserved positions</h5>
        <p class=ptext>The <span class=highlight>GPCR conserved positions</span> selection provides the possibility to rapidly select positions or domains conserved in the different GPCR family classes. The GPCR class of the protein being represented will be selected by default, and therefore the conserved positions/domains corresponding to that GPCR class will be available to visualize.
        </p>
        <p class=ptext>It is also possible to visualize the positions that correspond to conserved positions from other GPCR classes. For example, if your protein belongs to class A, you can represent the residue that corresponds to class B <span style="font-style:italic">2.50</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">2.50b</span>). Hover the buttons with your mouse for more information about the conserved positions and motifs, if available.</p>

        <h4 class=myheader>GPCRmd Toolkit</h4>

        <h5 class=subsect>Interaction network (Flare plots)</h5>
        <p class=ptext>If a flare plot is available for the simulation being displayed at the viewer, the option to obtain it will be available at the GPCRmd Toolkit section. Flare Plots are a tool for the study and representation of intra-protein interactions developed at the Stanford University by Dr. Fonseca and Dr Venkatakishnan. This approach makes it possible to obtain a highly visual depiction of complex data, such as the set of interactions formed between protein residues throughout MD simulations, in the form of circular interactive networks named Flare plots. 
Applied to the study of GPCRs, Flare plots are capable to generate networks which group protein residues according to the helix in which they belong and differentiate interactions between residues of the same helix from inter-helix interactions. <!--For the moment, flare plots are available for the representation of <span class=highlight>hydrogen bonds</span> formed between residues of the GPCR through a given simulation trajectory. Hydrogen bonds interactions-->Residue-residue interactions are represented as lines connecting residue pairs. Hover or click a residue to highligh the lines representing the interactions in which it participates.</p>
        <p class=ptext style="margin-bottom:10px">There are several options available </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class=highlight>Interacion type:</span> Select the type of interaciton to display on the plot.</li>
            <li><span class=highlight>Display:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class=highlight>Interacting pairs:</span>Show only a subset of interactions (intra- or inter-helix) or all of them.</li>
                    <li><span class=highlight>Simulation:</span> It is possible to summarize the interactions formed through all the trajectory frames. The frequency of each interaction is represented by the thickness of the lines connecting residues.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class=highlight>Show in structure:</span> Click to display structural representations of the residues selected (clicked) at the flare plot plot. Unclick to hyde them. If there are no residues selected at the flare plot, nothing will happen.</li>
            <li><span class=highlight>Clear plot:</span> Click to delete all selections made on the plot.</li>
            <li><span class=highlight>Download data (<span style="color: rgb(88, 88, 88);" title="Download data" class="glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt"></span>):</span> Click to download the plot data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class=subsect>Hbond frequency</h5>
        <p class=ptext>This tool identifies Hydrogen Bonds formed in a simulation, splitting the results between protein-protein hydrogen bonds and protein-not protein bonds. We use the MDTraj module function called <a href=http://mdtraj.org/1.8.0/api/generated/mdtraj.wernet_nilsson.html>"wernet_wilson"</a> , which basically stablishes a threshold distance of 3.3 Angstroms between the donor and acceptor atoms; more concretely, this threshold becomes progressively stricter as the angle formed by H-D-A increases (a perfect straight bond is 0 degrees, as the donor atom is central). You can select between a few options:</p>
        <ol style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <li><span class=highlight>Do not include Hbonds between neighbours:</span> If selected, excludes hydrogen bonds among residues which are less than 5 residues apart. These are usually the hydrogen bonds stabilizing alpha helices.</li>

            <li><span class=highlight>Include backbone Hydrogen Bonds:</span> If selected, includes hydrogen bonds formed between backbone (BB) atoms or side chains (SC) atoms, in any combination (SC-SC,BB-BB,SC-BB).</li>

            <li><span class=highlight>Only Side Chain Hydrogen Bonds:</span> If selected, only includes hydrogen bonds formed between side chain atoms.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class=ptext>

        Finally, you can set a frequency threshold so only those hydrogen bonds which hold the cited condition in a proportion of the frames greater than the value you have set will appear in the results. You can also define an interval of frames into which perform the analysis. <br>

        Results have a "Show Hbond" button next to them which displays the bond in the viewer. At the end of the results table, you can find a "Show All" button, which displays all the bonds in that table at once.<br>
        </p>

        <h5 class=subsect>Lig-prot interaction frequency</h5>
        <p class=ptext>This analysis tool calculates the frequency of interaction between the protein residues and a given ligand across a trajectory. When the distance between any of their atoms and the ligand is smaller than the threshold, it is considered to be an interaction. It is possible to chose which residue atoms will be considered (heavy atoms only or all atoms).
        The result is presented as table and a plot, which can be downloaded as an image (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stats" title="Save plot as image">)</span>. The residues that are found to interact can be displayed at the viewer screen (shown in purple), which can be deactivated using the "Display interacting residues" checkbox. It is also possible to download the interaction data obtained (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file save_data_dist_plot" title="Save data"></span>).</p>


        <h5 class=subsect>Salt bridge frequency</h5>
        <p class=ptext> This tool allows you to identify the salt bridges formed through a simulation. Salt bridges are defined as any combination between these two sets: {Arg-NH1, Arg-NH2, Lys-NZ, His-NE2, His-ND1} and {Glu-OE1, Glu-OE2, Asp-OD1, Asp-OD2} in which the participating atoms are closer than 4 Angstroms. Histidine atoms are only considered if the residue is protonated. As with hydrogen bond analysis, you can select a percentage threshold, and the results include a "Show Salt Bridge" button and a "Show All" button. Furthermore, you can select an interval of frames, instead of the whole trajectory.
        </p>



        <h5 class=subsect>Distance progression</h5>
        <p class=ptext  style="margin-bottom:10px">This tool is used to calculate the distance between atom pairs across the different frames of a trajectory, and therefore across time. 
        To calculate a distance, you need to indicate the pair or pairs of atoms you are interested in. This can be done in different ways:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Select a pair of atoms at the viewer screen by clicking on them and, afterwards, <span class=highlight>importing the created distances</span> with the blue arrow button <span style="color:#1e90ff" class="glyphicon glyphicon-circle-arrow-down"></span>.</li>
        <li>Indicate the desired atom pairs manually, by selecting "Compute distance between" <span class=highlight>atoms</span> and inputting a pair of atom indices at the text input fields.</li>
        <li>Indicate the desired atom pairs manually, by selecting "Compute distance between" <span class=highlight>residues</span> and indicating the residue, chain and atom name you are interested in. The residue number and chain name must be indicated according to the NGL selection language (ex. 50:P), and the atom name selected from the droplist.</li>
        </ul>
       <p class=ptext>It is also necessary to select the trajectory that will be used for the calculation. <br>
        
        Finally, just click at <span class=highlight>Compute</span>. Only atom pairs which are marked with a green checkmark (<span style="color:#7acc00;font-size:10px" class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>) will be considered, since the absence of a checkmark indicates an error in the input (only numbers are allowed).
        The result will appear as a plot of distance by time or by frame, which can be downloaded as an image (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stats" title="Save plot as image">)</span>. It is also possible to download the data obtained as a csv file (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file save_data_dist_plot" title="Save data"></span>). Moreover, the distances calculated can be displayed at the viewer screen, in the colors indicated at the plot legend. Such distance representations can be deactivated by deselecting the "Display distance" checkbox.</p>

        <h5 class=subsect>RMSD progression</h5>
        <p class=ptext>This tool computes the RMSD of all the conformations in a target trajectory to a reference conformation. It is necessary to indicate the trajectory to be used and the frames to be considered. Also, a reference frame of a given trajectory. It is possible to chose which atoms are going to be considered in the calculation: only alpha carbons, non-hydrogen protein atoms, protein C-alpha, etc.
        As in the case of distance analysis, the result will be shown in a plot (RMSD by time or by frame). It is possible to download the plot as an image (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stats" title="Save plot as image"></span>) or all the obtained data as a csv file (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file save_data_dist_plot" title="Save data"></span>).</p>




<!--        <h5 class=subsect>SASA analysis</h5>
        <p class=ptext> This tool allows you to compute the Solvent Accesible Surface Area(SASA) of a given set of atoms. We use the <a href=http://mdtraj.org/1.8.0/examples/solvent-accessible-surface-area.html>shrake_rupley</a> function from MDTraj module. Once we have the SASA value for each atom at each frame, we sum the SASA of all the atoms belonging to each frame. Then, we plot the obtained value per frame, so you can see how the SASA of that set of atoms fluctuates through time. We have defined a few options to define the atoms that will be considered:</p>

        <ol style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <li><span class=highlight>All atoms:</span> Includes all atoms in the simulation.</li>

            <li><span class=highlight>Sequence Selection:</span> Imports the selection you have defined in the <span class=highlight>Sequence Selection<span> tool (remember to click "Confirm Selection" button).</li>

            <li><span class=highlight>Receptor:</span>Includes all GPCR atoms.</li>

            <li><span class=highlight>Lower half of receptor:</span> Includes atoms in the GPCR whose Z component is less than the mean Z component of P atoms in the lipid leaflets.</li>

            <li><span class=highlight>Upper half of receptor:</span> The opposite of option 4.</li>

            <li><span class=highlight>Extracellular receptor:</span> Includes all atoms in the GPCR whose Z component is greater than the mean Z component of the P atoms in the outter membrane leaflet.</li>

            <li><span class=highlight>Intracelular receptor:</span> Includes all atoms in the GPCR whose Z component is less than the mean Z component of the P atoms in the inner membrane leaflet.</li>

        </ol>
        <p class=ptext>
            Furthermore, you can select an interval of frames, instead of the whole trajectory.
