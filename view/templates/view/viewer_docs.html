        <h4 class=myheader>General features</h4>
        <p class=ptext>Once you have selected the molecular representations and trajectories you want to visualize, click the <span class=highlight>Apply button</span> and they will appear in the screen. If you wish to use more complex visualization options, you can open the structure and trajectories in <a href="http://arose.github.io/mdsrv/" target="_blank">MDsrv</a> just by clicking at the <span class=highlight>MDsrv button</span>.</p>

        <p class=prelist>Mouse controls:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><span class=highlight>Left button hold and move:</span> rotate camera around center.</li>
        <li><span class=highlight>Middle button hold and move:</span> zoom camera in and out.</li>
        <li><span class=highlight>Middle button click:</span> center camera on atom.</li>
        <li><span class=highlight>Right button hold and move:</span> translate camera in screen plane.</li>
        <li><span class=highlight>Left button click:</span> pick atom or distance. 
            <ul>
                <li>When an atom is clicked, a label with information about it appears. Click at the background to deselect it, the label will disappear. To maintain a label, doubleclick on an atom. Doubleclick on a label to remove it. </li>
                <li>To draw a distance line between two atoms just single-click one atom after the other. Distances can be removed by doubleclicking on one of the atoms at the edges.</li> 
                <li>It is also possible to remove all the atom labels and distances at once, with the <span class=highlight>Clear dists. button</span>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class=myheader>Selection tools</h4>
        <p class=ptext>The viewer offers a set of tools to ease the selection of the atoms or molecules of interest.</p>
        <p class=ptext>First of all, the fast-selection buttons allow to rapidly activate or inactivate the display of the molecules present at the dynamics. Hover the buttons with your mouse to see the abbreviated name of these molecules, which can be used to create your own selections.</p>

        <p class=ptext>Use the text input field to specify a personalized selection. It can be used to restrict the molecular representation to the inputted set of atoms/molecules or to highlight them. The highlighted residues appear as green licorice representation. Please take into account that if a molecule is inactivated at the fast-selection buttons, it will not appear even if it is indicated here.<br>Selections must be expressed using the <a href="http://proteinformatics.charite.de/ngl/doc/index.html#User_manual/Usage/Selection_language" target="_blank">NGL selection language</a>. Moreover, to indicate protein residues it is also possible to use <span class=highlight>generic GPCR residue numbering</span>: Ballesteros-Weinstein (ex. <span style="font-style:italic">1.50</span>), GPCRdb structure-based numbering (ex. <span style="font-style:italic">1x50</span>) or a combination of both (ex. <span style="font-style:italic">1.50x50</span>).</p>

        <p class=ptext>The GPCR viewer also provides the option to <span class=highlight>select a protein segment from its sequence</span>. To do that, click at <span class=highlight>Select from the sequence</span> and set your selection by clicking at the desired range or ranges of residues. Selected segments will appear at the sequence in green. Finally, click at <span class=highlight>Add your selection</span>: the residue range(s) will be added to the text input field. To deselect a residue range from the sequence, just click on it.</p>

        <p class=prelist>It is also possible to <span class=highlight>select the residues or molecules that are found within a certain distance of a ligand</span>. It is only necessary to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Indicate what you want to visualize (residues or molecules found at the simulation).</li>
            <li>Input the wanted threshold distance (in angstroms).</li>
            <li>Indicate the ligand around which the selection is made. Apart from predefined ligands, it is also possible to show the residues/molecules that are close to a personalized selection, which, again, can include generic GPCR residue numbering.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class=ptext>If the selection is correct, a green tick will appear at the left. More than one distance selection can be displayed at the same time. Selections made with this tool will appear in coral red, with atoms that are within the threshold distance shown opaque and the rest of atoms of the residue/ligand shown with transparency. The  distance selection will be updated for each trajectory frame, as the disposition of atoms may change.</p> 

        <p class=ptext>The <span class=highlight>GPCR conserved positions</span> selection provides the possibility to select conserved positions or domains in the different GPCRs family classes. In this section, the GPCR class of the protein being represented will appear in bold. It is also possible to visualize in your protein the positions that correspond to conserved positions of other GPCR classes. For example, if your protein belongs to class A, you can represent the residue that corresponds to class B <span style="font-style:italic">2.50</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">2.50b</span>). Hover the buttons with your mouse for more information of the conserved positions or motifs. Class A positions are shown in blue, B in orange, C in yellow and F in pink.</p>

        <h4 class=myheader>Trajectories</h4>
        <p class=ptext>In this section you can find a checklist of the trajectories that are available. A play button will appear in the viewer screen for each of the selected trajectories. When a trajectory is played (or have been played and paused), a range bar appears, which allow you to easily navigate through all the different frames. You can move through the range bar or enter a desired frame in the small input field at its left.</p>

        <h4 class=myheader>Analysis tools</h4>
        <h5 class=subsect>Distance within 2 atoms</h5>
        <p class=ptext>This tool is used to calculate the distance between atom pairs across the different frames of a trajectory, and therefore across time. To calculate a distance, you can manually input pairs of atom indices at the text input fields. You can also select them in the viewer screen by clicking on the atoms and, afterwards, import the created distances with the blue arrow button. It is necessary to select the trajectory that will be used for the calculation. Finally, just click at Obtain result. Only atom pairs which are marked with a green tick will be considered, since the absence of a tick indicates an error in the input (only numbers are allowed).
        The result will appear as a plot of distance by time or by frame, which can be downloaded as an image (first button at the bottom). It is also possible to download the data obtained as a csv file (second button at the bottom). Moreover, the distances calculated can be displayed at the viewer screen, indicated in the color indicated at the plot legend.</p>

        <h5 class=subsect>RMSD</h5>
        <p class=ptext>In order to calculate the RMSD it is necessary to indicate the trajectory to be used and the frames to be considered. Also, a reference frame of a given trajectory. It is possible to chose which protein atoms are going to be considered in the calculation: only alpha carbons (backbone), non-hydrogen protein atoms (noh), protein C-alpha, C-beta, C, N, O (minimal) or all protein atoms.
        As in the case of distance analysis, the result will be shown in a plot (RMSD by time or by frame). It is possible to download the plot as an image (first button at the bottom) or all the obtained data as a csv file (second button at the bottom).</p>

        <h5 class=subsect>Ligand-residue interaction frequency</h5>
        <p class=ptext>This analysis tool calculates the frequency of interaction between the protein residues and a given ligand across a trajectory. When the distance between any of their atoms and the ligand is smaller than the threshold, it is considered to be an interaction. It is possible to chose which residue atoms will be considered (heavy atoms only or all atoms).
        The result is presented as table, and the residues that are found to interact can be dislayed at the viewer screen (shown in purple).</p>
