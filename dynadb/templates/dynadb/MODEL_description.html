             <p style="text-align: justify;" >(<b>A</b>) Fill in the form with general information about the crystalized part of the simulated system.</p>
             <p style="text-align: justify;" >(<b>B</b>) Fill the "Curated protein data". As the coordinates of a protein may have different sources (X-ray, homology modeling...), the table must be filled in a protein segment-wise fashion. A segment stands for a continuum fragment of the protein whose coordinates come from the same source. In cases where the coordinates of the whole protein come from the same source, only one row in the table is needed for that protein. Importantly, information about the segments of all the proteins submitted in the step 1 must be provided. Every segment must be labeled with the "<b>Prot #</b>" number of the protein to which it belongs (the "<b>Submitted proteins summary</b>" table shows the "<b>Prot #</b>" number for each submitted protein). In order to assign correctly the canonical GPCR numbering to your simulation system, please indicate the starting ("<b>From res</b>" field) and ending ("<b> To res</b>") residue numbers for each protein segment. After clicking the "Autocomplete resid" button, the Uniprot numbering will be later automatically assigned. In addition, indicate the source for coordinates of each crystalized or modeled protein segment, e.g. 'threading' for a modeled loop. Note that the "<b>PDB ID</b>" field in the table must be filled when the segment source is "X-ray" or "NMR".</p>

             <p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom:-5%;">(<b>C</b>) Indicate the "<b>Resname</b>" in the retrieved list of co-crystalized small molecules. Extra rows can be added to the table after clicking the "<b>+ Add molecule</b>" if molecules with more than one "<b>Resname</b>" exist in the set of crystalized molecules. Then, click the "<b>Validate</b>" button and the "<b>Num of mol</b>" will be automatically filled.</p>
