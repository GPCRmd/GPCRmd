PROTWIS
=======

Welcome to the Protwis project, the technology behind [GPCRdb](http://gpcrdb.org) and related systems.

For more information, please refer to our [documentation](http://docs.gpcrdb.org).

INSTALLATION
------------

* [Vagrant][vagrant]
* [Virtualbox][virtualbox]
* [Git][git]
* [GitHub][github] account

[vagrant]: http://www.vagrantup.com
[virtualbox]: https://www.virtualbox.org
[git]: http://git-scm.com
[github]: http://www.bitbucket.org

Install Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Git, and create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one).

Make sure you have the latest version of all three. On Ubuntu (and this may also apply to other Linux distros), the
package manager installs an old version of Vagrant, so you will have to download and install the latest version from
the Vagrant website.

#### Linux and Mac

##### Clone the protwis_vagrant repository from GitHub

Open up a terminal and type

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/protwis/protwis_vagrant.git ~/protwis_vagrant
    cd ~/protwis_vagrant

##### Fork the protwis repository

Go to https://github.com/protwis/protwis and click "Fork" in the top right corner

##### Clone the forked repository

Clone into the "shared" directory (replace your-username with your GitHub username)

    cd ~/protwis_vagrant
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/protwis.git shared/sites/protwis

##### Start the vagrant box

This may take a few minutes

    vagrant up

##### Log into the vagrant VM

    vagrant ssh

##### Start the built in Django development webserver

    cd /protwis/sites/protwis
    /env/bin/python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

You're all set up. The webserver will now be accessible from http://localhost:8000

You're all set up. The webserver will now be accessible from http://localhost:8000

#### Other notes

The protwis directory is now shared between the host machine and the virtual machine, and any changes made on the host
machine will be instantly reflected on the server.

To run django commands from the protwis directory, ssh into the VM, and use the "/env/bin/python3" command e.g

    cd ~/protwis_vagrant/
    vagrant ssh
    cd /protwis/sites/protwis
    /env/bin/python3 manage.py check protein

The database administration tool Adminer is installed and accessible at http://localhost:8001/adminer. Use the
following settings

    System: PostgreSQL
    Server: localhost
    Username: protwis
    Password: protwis
